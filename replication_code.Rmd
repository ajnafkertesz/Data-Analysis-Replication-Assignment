## Briefly about the project

This project is aimed at replicating the major findings of Gelfand et al. 2021 using open access data on COVID-19, as well as CTL scores by countries. 

The original cross-national analysis used Cultural Tightness Looseness (CTL) Scores to predict COVID-19 cases and death. Previous studies indicate that there is a large between-country variation in CTL scores. Some countries are more "tight", which means they have more norms in their society and they follow these norms more closely, while other countries are more "loose", with less norms and expectations in their society. The COVID-19 pandemic presented an interesting situation, where norm conformity and compliance with new norms and health recommendations (e.g., mask-wearing, social distancing...etc) became a direct predictor of infection and death rates. Therefore, Gelfand and her colleges were interested in investigating whether traditionally tighter countries did indeed have lower infection and death rates. 

First they ran simple correlations between centered CTL scores and infection and death rates. They graphed the line of best fit for these two correlation.
Next, they used ordinary least squares regression models where CTL was used as a predictor of COVID-19 infection rates. After this, they ran a second regression using CTL as a predictor of COVID-19 death rates. In both models, they adjusted for a number of covariaties including GINI, population density, power distance, local stay-at-home mandates...etc.

Below, I am replicating these models and plots.

## Discussion and reflection

Overall, my data replication project was very successful and I was able to replicate the models as well as the plots. Interestingly, the open-access code for the figures didn't actually produce the plot they had in the paper, but I was able to use some of the ggplot features and create an almost identical graph. 

Otherwise, I found the replication project relatively easy, since the data was already cleaned and well organized, which I personally find the hardest part of data analysis.
